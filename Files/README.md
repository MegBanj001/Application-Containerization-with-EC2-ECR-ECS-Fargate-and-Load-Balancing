# Simplifying-application-contanerization-with-EC2-ECR-ECS-Fargate-and-Load-Balancing

If you are new to containers, this step-by-step tutorial will show you how to leverage ECS to deploy containerized applications with load balancing, high availability, and proper database integration.
Do you want to use AWS to launch containerized apps without having to deal with Kubernetes' intricacy? Scalability and high availability are provided by AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), a fully managed solution that streamlines container orchestration.


# Features of AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- It enables you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or Fargate(Serverless compute).

- It distributes containers across multiple Availability Zones within a region to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services ELB, VPC, IAM, AWS CloudWatch, and AWS CodePipeline, enabling you to build comprehensive and scalable applications.

- It Provides built-in auto-scaling capabilities.


# Understanding AWS ECS Architecture and Components

ECS architecture comprises key components working together for container deployment and management:

**Clusters**: An ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services.

**Tasks**: Fundamental unit of ECS, tasks run containerized applications on EC2 instances or Fargate tasks.

**Task definition**: It is a blueprint for your application. You define parameters like Docker image, CPU, memory, networking, and dependencies.

**Service**: Maintain desired task count in a cluster, scaling automatically. Ensures high availability by distributing tasks and restarting failed ones.

**Container Instances**: EC2 instances or Fargate tasks running Docker daemon and hosting ECS containers.

ECS allows you 3 options to run your container-based application.

**AWS Fargate** — AWS manages the underlying infra where your containers will be running. It is serverless.

**AWS EC2 instances** — You run containers on the EC2 instances that you manage.

**On-prem VM** — You run your containers on on-prem VMs.

# Summary
- I was able to dockerize an app.

- Pushed the app to Amazon ECR.

- Deployed it on ECS Fargate.

- Exposed it via a Load Balancer
